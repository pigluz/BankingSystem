# BankingSystem

"This is a simple console-based banking application written in C# that allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance. It uses a list of BankAccount objects to store the accounts and checks for duplicate account numbers when creating a new account. However, it lacks better error handling and input validation." <br> 01.04.2023
